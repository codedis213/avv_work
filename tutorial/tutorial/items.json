Will your experience the same as customers who purchased these other supplements?</p>\n<h2>The Efficacy of OnBrain Clarity\u2019s Ingredients</h2>\n<p>Before discussing OnBrain Clarity\u2019s ingredients, it should be noted that there wasn\u2019t a product label shown on the supplement\u2019s website. Why is this important?</p>\n<p>Because there\u2019s no way to know how much of each ingredient the supplement contains, or if this is enough to provide any effect.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the only ingredients we\u2019re told about are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>L-Glutamine HCL</li>\n<li>Ginkgo Biloba</li>\n<li>Vinpocetine</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.highya.com/supplement-ingredients/testosterone-boosters-muscle-growth-male-enhancement-supplements-and-vitamins#ginkgo-biloba\">Ginkgo biloba</a> is listed as possibly effective for a variety of mental functions, including improving \u201cmemory, speed of thinking, and attention in healthy adults,\u201d reducing some symptoms of dementia, and more.</p>\n<p>The recommended dose of ginkgo for improving mental function is between 120-600mg per day, although we\u2019re not told how much is in OnBrain Clarity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.highya.com/supplement-ingredients/testosterone-boosters-muscle-growth-male-enhancement-supplements-and-vitamins#vinpocetine\">Vinpocetine</a> is listed as possibly effective for treating a small amount of memory decline related to Alzheimer\u2019s, although much of the existing research is decades old and of questionable quality.</p>\n<div class=\"section-advertisement advertisement ind-p\">\n<style scoped>\n.insidepdad { width: 300px; height: 250px; }\n@media(min-width: 500px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n@media(min-width: 800px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n</style>\n<script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<!-- InsidePDAD -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle insidepdad\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0040343918486417\" data-ad-slot=\"9650515638\" style=\"display:inline-block\"></ins>\n<script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script>\n</div>\n<p>Finally, there isn\u2019t enough evidence to claim that <a href=\"http://www.highya.com/supplement-ingredients/nootropics-brain-supplements-and-vitamins#l-glutamine\">l-glutamine</a> has any effective on thinking or brain function.</p>\n<p>Sure, the company claims that OnBrain Clarity is clinically proven to work, but they provide zero evidence to back it up.

But what\u2019s all this talk about alpha waves?</p>\n<h2>What Are Alpha Waves?

This is generally only accomplished through mindfulness or electrical stimulation.</p>\n<p>Alpha waves or not, what\u2019s the price for OnBrain Clarity?</p>\n<h2>The High Cost of OnBrain Clarity</h2>\n<p>Like many of the brain supplement\u2019s we\u2019ve previously reviewed, OnBrain Clarity comes with some fairly high prices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1-Month Supply</strong>: $54.95 plus $6.20 S&amp;H</li>\n<li><strong>3-Month Supply</strong>: $97.95 plus $7 S&amp;H</li>\n<li><strong>5-Month Supply</strong>: $158.95 plus $7 S&amp;H</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important note</strong>: If you attempt to click off the ordering page, you\u2019ll automatically receive a 30% discount.</p>\n<p>Unlike many of these other supplements (which is a good thing), OnBrain Clarity isn\u2019t sold only through a free trial, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be <a href=\"http://www.highya.com/article/what-is-an-autoship-program-and-why-should-you-avoid-it\">any kind of autoship program</a>. At least, not according to the company\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how much you buy, OnBrain Clarity comes with a 30-day refund policy, less S&amp;H charges and a $5 restocking fee per unit ordered.</p>\n<p>In order to request a refund, you\u2019ll need to call customer service at 855-836-6672.</p>\n<p>With all of this in mind, what\u2019s the real deal with OnBrain Clarity?</p>\n<h2>Will OnBrain Clarity Enhance Your Brain?</h2>\n<p>Between its mostly unproven ingredients, fairly outrageous claims, and high price, we don\u2019t think <strong>OnBrain Clarity</strong> will do much more than reduce you bank account balance.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you\u2019re looking to take anything to improve your brain function, you could probably walk down to your corner pharmacy and buy a bottle of ginkgo biloba.

This is generally only accomplished through mindfulness or electrical stimulation.\nAlpha waves or not, what\u2019s the price for OnBrain Clarity?\nThe High Cost of OnBrain Clarity\nLike many of the brain supplement\u2019s we\u2019ve previously reviewed, OnBrain Clarity comes with some fairly high prices:\n\n1-Month Supply: $54.95 plus $6.20 S&H\n3-Month Supply: $97.95 plus $7 S&H\n5-Month Supply: $158.95 plus $7 S&H\n\nImportant note: If you attempt to click off the ordering page, you\u2019ll automatically receive a 30% discount.\nUnlike many of these other supplements (which is a good thing), OnBrain Clarity isn\u2019t sold only through a free trial, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be any kind of autoship program. At least, not according to the company\u2019s Terms & Conditions.\nRegardless of how much you buy, OnBrain Clarity comes with a 30-day refund policy, less S&H charges and a $5 restocking fee per unit ordered.\nIn order to request a refund, you\u2019ll need to call customer service at 855-836-6672.\nWith all of this in mind, what\u2019s the real deal with OnBrain Clarity?\nWill OnBrain Clarity Enhance Your Brain?\nBetween its mostly unproven ingredients, fairly outrageous claims, and high price, we don\u2019t think OnBrain Clarity will do much more than reduce you bank account balance.\nIn fact, if you\u2019re looking to take anything to improve your brain function, you could probably walk down to your corner pharmacy and buy a bottle of ginkgo biloba. Not only would this option be less expensive than OnBrain Clarity, you\u2019d know exactly how much your were getting, so it\u2019d likely be much more effective.\nIn the mean time, be sure to learn about other ways you can naturally boost your productivity, which could ultimately give you an edge over the competition!\n", "main_title": "OnBrain Clarity Reviews ", "sub_category_title": "", "domain_name": "highya.com", "blog_title": "OnBrain Clarity Reviews ", "created_on": "2015-10-18 20:48:54.927110", "blog_link": "http://www.highya.com/onbrain-clarity-reviews", "domain_link": "http://www.highya.com/", "category_title": "Health & Beauty", "category_link": "/category/health-and-beauty"},
{"entry_content_html": "<div class=\"site-section section-article\">\n<h2>About Angee Home Security System</h2>\n<p>Billed as \u201cthe world\u2019s first truly autonomous home security system,\u201d the <strong>Angee Home Security System</strong> claims to provide you with personalized, completely secure, effortlessly usable, and absolutely reliable service. How?</p>\n<p>Angee can identify who you are, when you (and others) come and go, and can even understand what you say. The Angee Security System can also record, stream, and share videos of what\u2019s going on inside your home!</p>\n<p>And because Angee is fully automated, you won\u2019t have to worry about tapping a keypad every time you enter or leave.</p>\n<p>But does all of this mean that Angee is the right security system for you? It might sound cool, but there are a lot of considerations to keep in mind, which we\u2019ll discuss here.</p>\n<p>First, let\u2019s take a look at Angee\u2019s many features.</p>\n<h2>Angee Security System\u2019s Features</h2>\n<p>Overall, <strong>Angee</strong> is about ease of use. Or, as the company calls it, autonomy.</p>\n<p>So there aren\u2019t a lot of parts in the security system, and the company claims you can have it set up in as little as 30 seconds.</p>\n<h3>Angee\u2019s \u201cHub\u201d</h3>\n<p>The \u201chub\u201d of the Angee Security System is a 5.5\u201d cylindrical unit that houses a camera and a variety of other sensors (e.g. humidity, temperature, etc.). This central unit is also responsible for monitoring different \u201ctags\u201d (small cylindrical devices that can be stuck to windows and doors), which it communicates with using boosted Bluetooth technology.</p>\n<p>These tags can monitor motion (much like the base unit), but they also include an accelerometer that lets you know if a door or window is opened. You\u2019ll also be able to use Angee to connect to your home when you\u2019re out via your smartphone or tablet, where you can listen to audio message, read notifications (e.g. who\u2019s come and gone, where they went, etc.), and more.</p>\n<p>The company claims they also offer a smart watch app for Apple, Android, and Pebble OS.</p>\n<h3>When You\u2019re Not Home</h3>\n<p>While you\u2019re away, the Angee Home Security System will watch the room it\u2019s in using a built-in camera with 360-degree rotation and motion tracking technology to follow any movement. You\u2019ll also be able to easily set up four different \u201cactivity zones\u201d that Angee monitors specifically for activity, such as your back door, workstation, etc.</p>\n<p>If it senses activity, Angee can alert your smartphone and record 1080p video at 30fps. It will store up to an hour of video on the base unit, although additional space is available via a cloud (more about this in the Pricing section).</p>\n<p>Have pets? They won\u2019t interfere with Angee Home Security\u2019s performance, although you can set alerts if your pet jumps on furniture or anywhere else they\u2019re not supposed to (we\u2019re not exactly sure what you could do if you received a pet alert, though).</p>\n<h3>What Happens When You Get Home?</h3>\n<p>When you or someone else enters your home, disarming is fully automated, as the Angee System will attempt to identify them by their smartphone. If this doesn\u2019t work, it will then use voice recognition, which will only work if the correct password is said by the correct voice.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re home, the Angee System can be programmed to go into privacy mode, which deactivates the camera and turns to face the wall. And when you leave, it will automatically turn back on.</p>\n<p>You can even use the Angee Security System while you\u2019re home to watch kids playing in the other room, since the base unit features a 10-hour battery life.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how the Angee Home Security System works from the company\u2019s perspective, but how does it work in real life?</p>\n<h3>Angee Security System\u2019s \u2026 Security</h3>\n<p>The manufacturer claims that the communication between Angee and the cloud, as well as the data in the cloud, is encrypted using industry standard SSL technology (the same encryption framework as banks or the military).</p>\n<h2>What Does Angee Cost? What Are People Saying about It?</h2>\n<p>At the time of our research, Angee Home Security was in the midst of a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomtu/angee-the-first-truly-autonomous-home-security-sys?utm_source=meetangee&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;utm_campaign=header\">Kickstarter</a> crowdfunding campaign, where the company had already exceeded its goal by $75K. The expected ship date was October 2016.</p>\n<p>In the campaign, there were pledge options available between $1 and $7,499, although the minimum you\u2019d have to spend to get a system was $279. This included one Angee unit and one security tag for the main entrance door (we\u2019ll come back around to this in a moment).</p>\n<div class=\"section-advertisement advertisement ind-p\">\n<style scoped>\n.insidepdad { width: 300px; height: 250px; }\n@media(min-width: 500px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n@media(min-width: 800px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n</style>\n<script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<!-- InsidePDAD -->\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle insidepdad\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0040343918486417\" data-ad-slot=\"9650515638\" style=\"display:inline-block\"></ins>\n<script>\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</script>\n</div>\n<p>After release, the estimated price for this package will be $429.</p>\n<p>Outside of the purchase price, there aren\u2019t any mandatory monthly fees associated with the Angee Security System. You\u2019ll receive 1GB of free cloud storage for your recorded video, but if you need more, you can purchase an Amazon Web Services subscription.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, because it wasn\u2019t released yet, there weren\u2019t any hands-on reviews available at the time of our research. There were several writeups on popular sites like <a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/angee-home-security-system/39370/\">Gizmag</a>, <a href=\"http://www.techtimes.com/articles/93633/20151009/angee-first-truly-autonomous-home-security-system.htm\">Tech Times</a>, <a href=\"http://www.slashgear.com/angee-autonomous-home-security-system-has-voice-recognition-and-more-09408965/\">Slashgear</a>, and more, although these were more high-level overviews than they were in-depth reviews.</p>\n<p>Is there anything else out there quite like the Angee Security System?</p>\n<h2>Are There Similar Options To Angee Home Security?</h2>\n<p>Similar? Yes, there are several options, including <a href=\"http://canary.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canary</a>, <a href=\"https://nest.com/camera/meet-nest-cam/\">Nest Cam</a> (from the same company that brought you the <a href=\"http://www.highya.com/nest-learning-thermostat-reviews\">Nest Learning Thermostat</a>), <a href=\"https://getpiper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Piper</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/products/netatmo-welcome/\">Netatmo Welcome</a>.</p>\n<p>Identical? Definitely not. When comparing themselves to the competition, here\u2019s how the folks at Angee Inc. put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOur approach to security is much more thorough. We secure all entry points and use advanced proximity sensing of nearby phones. This makes Angee more automated and more reliable. Also, Angee is not just a home security system, it's an intelligent robot! Angee gives you a full 360\u00b0 view of your home - with all of its functionality controlled by your voice - streaming, recording, automatic rotation to motion - and its portable so you can take it anywhere. Additionally, Angee has access to your favorite internet data and services to make your life more convenient.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Thinking about Purchasing Angee? Which Option Should You Buy?</h2>\n<p>Based on Angee Security\u2019s Kickstarter page, you have 5 different packages to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Angee base unit, 1 security tag</li>\n<li>1 Angee base unit, 3 security tags</li>\n<li>2 Angee base units, 4 security tags</li>\n<li>3 Angee base units, 5 security tags</li>\n<li>4 Angee base units, 6 security tags</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which is the best option for you? While we think the company did a great job of explaining the technology behind Angee and what separates it from the competition, we think they could have provided customers with a better understanding of how to choose the right package.</p>\n<p>All we\u2019re told is some vague, high-level information:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c[One Angee Unit is] aimed at use in apartments, and with multiple Angee units it can cover large houses. Tests show perfect functionality in open space over 100 feet (30m). If your home has thick walls you will need multiple devices to cover that area.</p>\n<p>For smaller homes [what size?], we'd recommend Angee + a sensor to cover the main door - it is often enough to give you fully automated full-perimeter security. That said, if you want to video monitor multiple areas (e.g. baby room, garage, etc.) Angee is great for accessing these places instantly from its awesome mobile application. For a larger home, we recommend purchasing the 3-pack so that you are able to monitor multiple locations at once. Please consider that for use in houses where wall material / thickness may be problematic for a wireless signal, more units, or more security tags are recommended to cover that area well.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We\u2019re also not informed how many tags can be paired with each base unit (do you really need 4 base units just to control 6 different tags?), although you can\u2019t currently purchase tags separately.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s all of this mean for you?</p>\n<h2>Should You Back the Angee Home Security System?</h2>\n<p>The rate at which technology develops gets faster each and every day, so it\u2019s an exciting time to be alive. And it\u2019s also exciting that there are platforms like Kickstarter to help many technology startups get their ideas of the ground.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, some technology startups have recently become legendary flops (many of which received their original funding through crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter), including <a href=\"http://www.highya.com/coin-credit-card-reviews\">Coin Credit Card</a>, <a href=\"http://www.highya.com/stonetether-reviews\">StoneTether</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.highya.com/trackr-reviews\">TrackR</a>.</p>\n<p>The point? Yes, the technology behind Angee Home Security looks great, and it\u2019s not like anything else on the market.</p>\n<p>But in a best-case scenario, you\u2019ll have to wait until October 2016 to receive yours. And if\u2014like so many other tech startups lately\u2014some glitches pop up along the way, it might take even longer as shipping times get pushed back.</p>\n<p>In a worst-case scenario, you could lose your entire investment with nothing to show for it.</p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019re passionate about the latest trends in gadgets and technology and are typically and early adopter, then the Angee Security System might be right up your alley.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want tried-and-true technology with no \u201chiccups,\u201d then you might want to wait until after its official release to purchase your own Angee Home Security System.</p>\n</div>", "main_title_link": "http://www.highya.com/angee-home-security-system-reviews", "sub_category_link": "", "entry_content_text": "\nAbout Angee Home Security System\nBilled as \u201cthe world\u2019s first truly autonomous home security system,\u201d the Angee Home Security System claims to provide you with personalized, completely secure, effortlessly usable, and absolutely reliable service.
