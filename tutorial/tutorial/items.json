OnBrain Clarity can even support overall brain health!\nUsing only a combination of essential vitamins, nutrients, and amino acids, OnBrain Clarity claims to be clinically proven to provide a 55% increase in alpha wave magnitude, a 26% improvement in processing speed, and a 14% improvement in memory recall speed.\nCompared to energy drinks and other methods, OnBrain Clarity is a smarter, healthier, and more powerful option that represents \u201ccutting edge of brain enhancement.\u201d\nThat\u2019s some sleek, sexy marketing! But does OnBrain Clarity live up to the hype, or fall flat on its face? We\u2019re here to help you make an informed decision, so we\u2019ll start with exactly what OnBrain Clarity is.\nWhat Kind of Supplement is OnBrain Clarity?\nOnBrain Clarity is a specific type of nutritional supplement known as a nootropic. Basically, these are substances that, by themselves or when combined with other ingredients, are claimed to provide some boost in mental function.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve reviewed a lot of these ever-popular brain health supplements here at HighYa, including Cogniflex, Adderin, Geniux, and many more. And overall, most HighYa readers don\u2019t seem pleased with their nootropic purchased, primarily based on complaints of failure to work, high prices, and poor customer service experiences (difficulty obtaining refunds and cancelling trials \u2013 more shortly).\nPro tip: Want the easiest way to get yourself up to date on all things nootropics? Be sure to read The Truth About Memory Supplements.\nWhat about OnBrain Clarity? Will your experience the same as customers who purchased these other supplements?\nThe Efficacy of OnBrain Clarity\u2019s Ingredients\nBefore discussing OnBrain Clarity\u2019s ingredients, it should be noted that there wasn\u2019t a product label shown on the supplement\u2019s website. Why is this important?\nBecause there\u2019s no way to know how much of each ingredient the supplement contains, or if this is enough to provide any effect.\nNonetheless, the only ingredients we\u2019re told about are:\n\nL-Glutamine HCL\nGinkgo Biloba\nVinpocetine\n\nGinkgo biloba is listed as possibly effective for a variety of mental functions, including improving \u201cmemory, speed of thinking, and attention in healthy adults,\u201d reducing some symptoms of dementia, and more.\nThe recommended dose of ginkgo for improving mental function is between 120-600mg per day, although we\u2019re not told how much is in OnBrain Clarity.\nVinpocetine is listed as possibly effective for treating a small amount of memory decline related to Alzheimer\u2019s, although much of the existing research is decades old and of questionable quality.\n\n\n.insidepdad { width: 300px; height: 250px; }\n@media(min-width: 500px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n@media(min-width: 800px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nFinally, there isn\u2019t enough evidence to claim that l-glutamine has any effective on thinking or brain function.\nSure, the company claims that OnBrain Clarity is clinically proven to work, but they provide zero evidence to back it up. We think this is purposeful, because OnBrain has not been clinically proven in any way.\nOnBrain Clarity\u2019s Side Effects\nDespite their limited effectiveness, most of OnBrain Clarity\u2019s ingredients (at least the handful we\u2019re told about) shouldn\u2019t cause any major side effects for most users.\nIf anything, you might experience mild digestive upset, although it\u2019s always a good idea to talk with your doctor before beginning any new supplement regimen.\nOk, so OnBrain Clarity\u2019s ingredients don\u2019t seem to be quite as revolutionary as the manufacturer makes them seem. But what\u2019s all this talk about alpha waves?\nWhat Are Alpha Waves? Can They Be Boosted?\nThis is a fairly large, complicated topic, but at its most basic, alpha brain waves are produced by our brain when we\u2019re relaxed and have our eyes closed.\nAs you might imagine (no pun intended), alpha brain waves occur in their highest concentration while we\u2019re performing mindfulness techniques (such as meditation). And there\u2019s some preliminary research showing that boosted alpha wave activity can lead to reduced symptoms of depression and increased creativity.\nHowever, there isn\u2019t enough clinical evidence available showing that any supplement ingredients (not just those contained in OnBrain Clarity) can boost your alpha waves. This is generally only accomplished through mindfulness or electrical stimulation.\nAlpha waves or not, what\u2019s the price for OnBrain Clarity?\nThe High Cost of OnBrain Clarity\nLike many of the brain supplement\u2019s we\u2019ve previously reviewed, OnBrain Clarity comes with some fairly high prices:\n\n1-Month Supply: $54.95 plus $6.20 S&H\n3-Month Supply: $97.95 plus $7 S&H\n5-Month Supply: $158.95 plus $7 S&H\n\nImportant note: If you attempt to click off the ordering page, you\u2019ll automatically receive a 30% discount.\nUnlike many of these other supplements (which is a good thing), OnBrain Clarity isn\u2019t sold only through a free trial, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be any kind of autoship program. At least, not according to the company\u2019s Terms & Conditions.\nRegardless of how much you buy, OnBrain Clarity comes with a 30-day refund policy, less S&H charges and a $5 restocking fee per unit ordered.\nIn order to request a refund, you\u2019ll need to call customer service at 855-836-6672.\nWith all of this in mind, what\u2019s the real deal with OnBrain Clarity?\nWill OnBrain Clarity Enhance Your Brain?\nBetween its mostly unproven ingredients, fairly outrageous claims, and high price, we don\u2019t think OnBrain Clarity will do much more than reduce you bank account balance.\nIn fact, if you\u2019re looking to take anything to improve your brain function, you could probably walk down to your corner pharmacy and buy a bottle of ginkgo biloba. Not only would this option be less expensive than OnBrain Clarity, you\u2019d know exactly how much your were getting, so it\u2019d likely be much more effective.\nIn the mean time, be sure to learn about other ways you can naturally boost your productivity, which could ultimately give you an edge over the competition!\n", "main_title": "OnBrain Clarity Reviews ", "sub_category_title": "", "domain_name": "highya.com", "blog_title": "OnBrain Clarity Reviews ", "blog_link": "http://www.highya.com/onbrain-clarity-reviews", "domain_link": "http://www.highya.com/", "category_title": "Health & Beauty", "category_link": "/category/health-and-beauty"},

But before you hand over your money, there are some important considerations to keep in mind.\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the basics.\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between a Refinishing & Restaining?\nThis is important to address because One Wipe claims to refinish and restain, presumably unlike the competition (more about this in the next section).\nHere\u2019s the thing though: Technically, these mean the same thing.\nObviously, restaining references applying a new coat of stain to a wood surface, whether fresh or over an already existing coat. Similarly, refinishing means, \u201cto give a new surface to (wood, furniture, etc.).\u201d Why are we telling you this?\nBecause ultimately, this seems to be a bunch of marketing hype from the manufacturer, instead of a meaningful difference we can use to make an informed purchasing decision.\nWhat other kinds of products will you find that do the same thing as One Wipe Wood Restorer?\nAre There Other Wood Restorers on the Market?\nWe know your time is valuable, so here\u2019s the fastest way to see what kind of competition One Wipe has: Type the phrase \u201cwood restorer\u201d or \u201cwood refinisher\u201d into your favorite search engine.\nYou\u2019ll see a lot of online options, but you\u2019ll probably also notice just how many are available through local retailers as well. Most of these products are less expensive than One Wipe Wood Restorer\u2014especially when you factor in its non-refundable S&H charges (more in a second)!\nRegardless if you choose One Wipe or another brand of wood restorer, how do they work?\nHow Wood Restorers Like One Wipe Work\nFully restoring a wood surface can take a whole lot of work, and making the results blend in unnoticed can take years (or even decades) of experience to master.\nThis is where wood restoration products like One Wipe claim to help; you\u2019ll get near-professional results at a much lower cost, and without the required time or level of expertise.\nBasically, they remove all the dirt, grime, and oily residue that can accumulate over the years. In essence, they clean them. Many of these products also contain waxes (or waxy ingredients), which simultaneously fill in shallow scratches so they\u2019re no longer visible.\nThe more we dig into One Wipe Wood Restorer, the less revolutionary it seems, right? Will its price make it worthwhile?\n\n\n.insidepdad { width: 300px; height: 250px; }\n@media(min-width: 500px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n@media(min-width: 800px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nHow Much Does One Wipe Wood Restorer Cost?\nTwo bottles of One Wipe Wood Restorer are priced at $19.95 plus $15.90 S&H (there will also be a $2 \u201cweb surcharge fee\u201d for all online orders). With your order, you\u2019ll need to choose between dark and light wood options, and will receive a bottle of High Gloss Finish, as well as an application sponge.\nAll One Wipe orders come with a 30-day refund policy, less S&H charges.\nDid you catch that? If you\u2019re dissatisfied, this means by the time you ship everything back to the manufacturer, you could lose more in S&H charges than you\u2019ll receive as a refund!\nNonetheless, you can request a refund by calling SAS Group\u2019s customer service department at 866-248-9853.\nWait! Before we move on, let\u2019s talk about arbitration.\nOne Wipe\u2019s Arbitration\nAll SAS Group products are sold through a binding arbitration agreement. Basically, this means that if you experienced any damages using one of their products, the legal actions you could take against the company would be severely restricted.\nWant to go through a trial by jury? Thinking about becoming part of a class action lawsuit? These options would no longer be available to you.\nSpeaking of SAS Group, what\u2019s the company\u2019s online reputation?\nOnline Customer Feedback for One Wipe Restorer\u2019s Manufacturer\nAs we discussed above, One Wipe is manufactured by SAS Group based out of Neenah, WI, a middle-market ASOTV company. Despite its market position, the company does have some breakthrough products, including the original Dutch Glow formula.\nHere on HighYa, more than 300 readers had provided their feedback about the original version as of 10/13/15. The verdict? It had an average rating of 1.5 stars, based on common complaints of failure to work as advertised, poor quality, and underhanded selling tactics.\nOn the Better Business Bureau website, SAS Group had a D+ rating based on 128 closed complaints. Nearly all of these referenced products sneakily added to orders, as well as orders placed without consent.\nShould you expect the same with One Wipe Wood Restorer? It\u2019s such a new product so there\u2019s no way to know for sure, although we\u2019d definitely be careful when ordering, just in case.\nGiven all this, should you buy One Wipe Wood Restorer?\nIs One Wipe the Best Wood Restorer Option for You?\nGiven the fact that nearly identical wood restorers can be found at almost any hardware or home improvement store, it might make sense to purchase One Wipe if it featured a lower price.\nBut since One Wipe\u2019s price seems to be much higher than the competition\u2014even before you factor in the high, non-refundable S&H charges\u2014the overall value doesn\u2019t seem to be there. As a result, there\u2019s really not much of an incentive for giving it a try.\nGranted, we\u2019re not saying that One Wipe Wood Restorer won\u2019t work; only that we\u2019d recommend exploring local options before placing your order.\n", "main_title": "One Wipe Wood Restorer by Dutch Glow Reviews ", "sub_category_title": "", "domain_name": "highya.com", "blog_title": "One Wipe Wood Restorer by Dutch Glow Reviews ", "blog_link": "http://www.highya.com/one-wipe-wood-restorer-by-dutch-glow-reviews", "domain_link": "http://www.highya.com/", "category_title": "Home & Garden", "category_link": "/category/home-and-garden"},
{"main_title_link": "http://www.highya.com/mineral-air-reviews", "sub_category_link": "", "entry_content_text": "\nAbout Mineral Air\nMineral Air is a rechargeable, lightweight, and cordless airbrush system that provides precise, one-touch control for sheer, flawless makeup coverage.\nAnd unlike other airbrush systems, you won\u2019t have to worry about separate compressors with Mineral Air, or about makeup switches or open reservoirs that can spill during use. You\u2019ll just get coverage so sheer that it\u2019ll look professionally airbrushed, in only 10-15 seconds!\nThe Mineral Air system also uses a unique delivery system that applies a layer of micronized mineral spheres within the 4-in-1 hydrating foundation, which won\u2019t clog pores. The result?\nYou\u2019ll be able to conceal unwanted blemishes, age spots, rosacea, and dark circles, without heavy caking, and with more breathable coverage than most powder or liquid foundations. This means that Mineral Air not only \u201cmakes professional results easy,\u201d but it\u2019s also effective for all skin types\u2014even sensitive skin.\nMineral Air\u2019s claims certainly seem alluring. But will this cordless airbrush system help you effortlessly look beautiful, or will you abandon it after just a couple uses?\nFirst, is Mineral Air in a class of its own?\nIs Mineral Air the \u201cFirst Cordless Airbrush System in the World?\u201d\nWe\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of ASOTV products here at HighYa, and if we\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that they\u2019re often just slightly redesigned versions of existing products. Sometimes there\u2019s a lot of competition, and others there\u2019s very little.\nIn this instance, the only popular product that bears much resemblance to Mineral Air is the Temptu Air. Granted, the Temptu is designed differently and is larger (and perhaps less portable) than Mineral Air, but it\u2019s really the only other cordless makeup airbrush system.\nInterestingly, Temptu features pre-filled makeup \u201cAirpods\u201d that attach directly to the unit, preventing you from having to manually refill when you run out (or when you want to switch colors). Is this how Mineral Air works?\nExactly How Does Mineral Air Work?\nThe short answer? We\u2019re told very little about the details behind Mineral Air, including how it works.\nBased on the pictures, it appears to mimic the shape of a large perfume bottle and to be battery operated. Just press a button on top and the foundation sprays out through something the company calls \u201cmicronized mineral spheres.\u201d\nPro tip: Micronized simply means to \u201cbreak a substance into very fine particles.\u201d So this is something that all makeup airbrush kits will provide (more about this shortly), not just Mineral Air. It\u2019s just marketing spin.\nOutside of this, there\u2019s essentially zero information provided, so we don\u2019t know how much makeup it uses, if the nozzle can be adjusted, or any other important information.\nThe company claims that Mineral Air is easier to use than a standard airbrush system (and causes less dripping), although you\u2019ll almost certainly lose nearly all of the adjustability of one of these larger systems.\n\n\n.insidepdad { width: 300px; height: 250px; }\n@media(min-width: 500px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n@media(min-width: 800px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that effective airbrushing techniques can take a lot of time to perfect. So while the Mineral Air might be easier to use, you probably shouldn\u2019t expect professional results right out of the gate.\nCompared to professional systems, how much does Mineral Air cost?\nHow Much Does Mineral Air Cost?\nProfessional makeup airbrush systems can cost thousands of dollars, but Mineral Air is priced at four payments of $59.95 plus $14.95 S&H, for a total of $254.75.\nYou\u2019ll be able to choose between black and white colors, as well as between six different foundation base colors: porcelain, light, medium, medium tan, tan, and deep.\nAlong with this, you\u2019ll receive a bronzer set, brush set, and $100 in free makeup, including a 30-day multi-shade match kit. You\u2019ll even get 90 additional days of the company\u2019s 4-in-1 foundation!\nAll Mineral Air purchases come with a 30-day refund policy, less S&H charges. In order to request a refund, you\u2019ll need to contact customer service at (888) 996-3585.\nPro tip: What happens when you run out of Mineral Air foundation? There isn\u2019t a way to purchase refills on the product\u2019s website, and there\u2019s no indication if you can use other brands of airbrush makeup. This might present a big problem down the road!\nSpeaking of Mineral Air\u2019s foundation, what\u2019s it made with?\nMineral Air\u2019s Foundation Ingredients\nLike the device itself, we\u2019re told very little about Mineral Air\u2019s foundation, other than that it:\n\nContains pomegranate, argan oil, seaweed, and 100% pure minerals,\nDoes not contain parabens or talc, and\nReplaces the need for a primer, concealer, makeup, and hydrating serum, making it a 4-in-1 product.\n\nThis makes it seem like many other foundations on the market, except for the fact it\u2019s likely (again, we\u2019re not told) formulated to easily pass through the Mineral Air sprayer, without clogging. This is where that whole \u201cmicronized\u201d concept comes in that we discussed earlier.\nShould You Splurge on Mineral Air?\nDo you need the Mineral Air cordless airbrush system? Probably not. But you almost certainly crave that airbrush-beautiful makeup you see on the runway and in the movies, but you don\u2019t want to commit to an expensive and time-consuming system.\nBecause of this, Mineral Air might seem like a really attractive option. But if we\u2019re being honest, there\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know about the portable airbrush system (what\u2019s contained in the foundation, how to purchase refills, if other kinds of foundation can be used, etc.), it\u2019s all but impossible to understand what kind of value it\u2019ll provide.\nWe will say this though: Even if Mineral Air worked exactly as the manufacturer claimed, it often takes time and practice to obtain professional-level airbrushing results. So if you think you\u2019ll achieve this from day one, you\u2019re bound to end up disappointed.\nOur recommendation? If you\u2019re only in the market for a cordless airbrush makeup system, you might want to check out the Temptu locally, and speak with a beauty professional about the pros and cons. Not only will this save you money, but you\u2019ll be able to put it in your hands before purchasing.\nThen, if you find that the Temptu isn\u2019t right for you, you can spring for Mineral Air. Just keep in mind that you might lose $20+ in non-refundable S&H charges just for giving it a try!\n", "main_title": "Mineral Air Reviews ", "sub_category_title": "", "domain_name": "highya.com", "blog_title": "Mineral Air Reviews ", "blog_link": "http://www.highya.com/mineral-air-reviews", "domain_link": "http://www.highya.com/", "category_title": "Health & Beauty", "category_link": "/category/health-and-beauty"},

How?\nAngee can identify who you are, when you (and others) come and go, and can even understand what you say. The Angee Security System can also record, stream, and share videos of what\u2019s going on inside your home!\nAnd because Angee is fully automated, you won\u2019t have to worry about tapping a keypad every time you enter or leave.\nBut does all of this mean that Angee is the right security system for you? It might sound cool, but there are a lot of considerations to keep in mind, which we\u2019ll discuss here.\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at Angee\u2019s many features.\nAngee Security System\u2019s Features\nOverall, Angee is about ease of use. Or, as the company calls it, autonomy.\nSo there aren\u2019t a lot of parts in the security system, and the company claims you can have it set up in as little as 30 seconds.\nAngee\u2019s \u201cHub\u201d\nThe \u201chub\u201d of the Angee Security System is a 5.5\u201d cylindrical unit that houses a camera and a variety of other sensors (e.g. humidity, temperature, etc.). This central unit is also responsible for monitoring different \u201ctags\u201d (small cylindrical devices that can be stuck to windows and doors), which it communicates with using boosted Bluetooth technology.\nThese tags can monitor motion (much like the base unit), but they also include an accelerometer that lets you know if a door or window is opened. You\u2019ll also be able to use Angee to connect to your home when you\u2019re out via your smartphone or tablet, where you can listen to audio message, read notifications (e.g. who\u2019s come and gone, where they went, etc.), and more.\nThe company claims they also offer a smart watch app for Apple, Android, and Pebble OS.\nWhen You\u2019re Not Home\nWhile you\u2019re away, the Angee Home Security System will watch the room it\u2019s in using a built-in camera with 360-degree rotation and motion tracking technology to follow any movement. You\u2019ll also be able to easily set up four different \u201cactivity zones\u201d that Angee monitors specifically for activity, such as your back door, workstation, etc.\nIf it senses activity, Angee can alert your smartphone and record 1080p video at 30fps. It will store up to an hour of video on the base unit, although additional space is available via a cloud (more about this in the Pricing section).\nHave pets? They won\u2019t interfere with Angee Home Security\u2019s performance, although you can set alerts if your pet jumps on furniture or anywhere else they\u2019re not supposed to (we\u2019re not exactly sure what you could do if you received a pet alert, though).\nWhat Happens When You Get Home?\nWhen you or someone else enters your home, disarming is fully automated, as the Angee System will attempt to identify them by their smartphone. If this doesn\u2019t work, it will then use voice recognition, which will only work if the correct password is said by the correct voice.\nWhen you\u2019re home, the Angee System can be programmed to go into privacy mode, which deactivates the camera and turns to face the wall. And when you leave, it will automatically turn back on.\nYou can even use the Angee Security System while you\u2019re home to watch kids playing in the other room, since the base unit features a 10-hour battery life.\nThat\u2019s how the Angee Home Security System works from the company\u2019s perspective, but how does it work in real life?\nAngee Security System\u2019s \u2026 Security\nThe manufacturer claims that the communication between Angee and the cloud, as well as the data in the cloud, is encrypted using industry standard SSL technology (the same encryption framework as banks or the military).\nWhat Does Angee Cost? What Are People Saying about It?\nAt the time of our research, Angee Home Security was in the midst of a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, where the company had already exceeded its goal by $75K. The expected ship date was October 2016.\nIn the campaign, there were pledge options available between $1 and $7,499, although the minimum you\u2019d have to spend to get a system was $279. This included one Angee unit and one security tag for the main entrance door (we\u2019ll come back around to this in a moment).\n\n\n.insidepdad { width: 300px; height: 250px; }\n@media(min-width: 500px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n@media(min-width: 800px) { .afterproductpdad { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nAfter release, the estimated price for this package will be $429.\nOutside of the purchase price, there aren\u2019t any mandatory monthly fees associated with the Angee Security System. You\u2019ll receive 1GB of free cloud storage for your recorded video, but if you need more, you can purchase an Amazon Web Services subscription.\nUnfortunately, because it wasn\u2019t released yet, there weren\u2019t any hands-on reviews available at the time of our research. There were several writeups on popular sites like Gizmag, Tech Times, Slashgear, and more, although these were more high-level overviews than they were in-depth reviews.\nIs there anything else out there quite like the Angee Security System?\nAre There Similar Options To Angee Home Security?\nSimilar? Yes, there are several options, including Canary, Nest Cam (from the same company that brought you the Nest Learning Thermostat), Piper, and Netatmo Welcome.\nIdentical? Definitely not. When comparing themselves to the competition, here\u2019s how the folks at Angee Inc. put it:\n\n\u201cOur approach to security is much more thorough. We secure all entry points and use advanced proximity sensing of nearby phones. This makes Angee more automated and more reliable. Also, Angee is not just a home security system, it's an intelligent robot! Angee gives you a full 360\u00b0 view of your home - with all of its functionality controlled by your voice - streaming, recording, automatic rotation to motion - and its portable so you can take it anywhere. Additionally, Angee has access to your favorite internet data and services to make your life more convenient.\u201d\n\nThinking about Purchasing Angee? Which Option Should You Buy?\nBased on Angee Security\u2019s Kickstarter page, you have 5 different packages to choose from:\n\n1 Angee base unit, 1 security tag\n1 Angee base unit, 3 security tags\n2 Angee base units, 4 security tags\n3 Angee base units, 5 security tags\n4 Angee base units, 6 security tags\n\nWhich is the best option for you? While we think the company did a great job of explaining the technology behind Angee and what separates it from the competition, we think they could have provided customers with a better understanding of how to choose the right package.\nAll we\u2019re told is some vague, high-level information:\n\n\u201c[One Angee Unit is] aimed at use in apartments, and with multiple Angee units it can cover large houses. Tests show perfect functionality in open space over 100 feet (30m). If your home has thick walls you will need multiple devices to cover that area.\nFor smaller homes [what size?], we'd recommend Angee + a sensor to cover the main door - it is often enough to give you fully automated full-perimeter security. That said, if you want to video monitor multiple areas (e.g. baby room, garage, etc.) Angee is great for accessing these places instantly from its awesome mobile application. For a larger home, we recommend purchasing the 3-pack so that you are able to monitor multiple locations at once. Please consider that for use in houses where wall material / thickness may be problematic for a wireless signal, more units, or more security tags are recommended to cover that area well.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re also not informed how many tags can be paired with each base unit (do you really need 4 base units just to control 6 different tags?), although you can\u2019t currently purchase tags separately.\nWhat\u2019s all of this mean for you?\nShould You Back the Angee Home Security System?\nThe rate at which technology develops gets faster each and every day, so it\u2019s an exciting time to be alive. And it\u2019s also exciting that there are platforms like Kickstarter to help many technology startups get their ideas of the ground.\nOn the flip side, some technology startups have recently become legendary flops (many of which received their original funding through crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter), including Coin Credit Card, StoneTether, and TrackR.\nThe point? Yes, the technology behind Angee Home Security looks great, and it\u2019s not like anything else on the market.\nBut in a best-case scenario, you\u2019ll have to wait until October 2016 to receive yours. And if\u2014like so many other tech startups lately\u2014some glitches pop up along the way, it might take even longer as shipping times get pushed back.\nIn a worst-case scenario, you could lose your entire investment with nothing to show for it.\nSo, if you\u2019re passionate about the latest trends in gadgets and technology and are typically and early adopter, then the Angee Security System might be right up your alley.\nOn the other hand, if you want tried-and-true technology with no \u201chiccups,\u201d then you might want to wait until after its official release to purchase your own Angee Home Security System.\n", "main_title": "Angee Home Security System Reviews ", "sub_category_title": "", "domain_name": "highya.com", "blog_title": "Angee Home Security System Reviews ", "blog_link": "http://www.highya.com/angee-home-security-system-reviews", "domain_link": "http://www.highya.com/", "category_title": "Home & Garden", "category_link": "/category/home-and-garden"},

Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve will fit on either your right or left foot, too!\nDr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve claims to be the \u201conly surgery-free way to relieve bunion pain.\u201d Is this really the case? And if it is, does this necessarily mean that it provides a solid value?\nTo answer all your important questions, let\u2019s start by taking a look at what a bunion is.\nWhat is a Bunion?\nA bunion is a large, bony bump that forms at the base of your big toe, and is caused by constant outward pressure on the first metatarsal bone. In many instances, ill-fitting footwear (especially high-heel shoes) can lead to bunion formation, but genetics is thought to play just as large of a role.\nContrary to what Dr. A\u2019s claims, there are numerous methods of easing bunion pain without surgery, including maintaining a healthy weight, using shoe inserts to properly position your feet, making sure your footwear fits properly, and more.\nOf course, one of these viable options is to wear gel-filled pads like the one contained in Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve. Are there other similar products out there?\nOther Options Similar To Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve\nPop quiz: How many similar products to Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve do you think are available in the marketplace? A hundred? Several hundred?\nYou can quickly find out by typing the phrase \u201cbunion sleeve,\u201d \u201cbunion pad,\u201d or \u201cbunion cushion\u201d into the search engine of your choice. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s well over a thousand.\nBut the truth is that you probably don\u2019t even need to shop online for one of these products, since they\u2019re so popular you\u2019ll almost certainly find options at local retailers near you!\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. Many of these alternatives will be priced much lower than Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve, which we\u2019ll talk more about next.\nBefore we go though, keep in mind that not all of these options will be designed exactly like the Dr. A\u2019s version, but they might work just as well (or better, depending on your needs). We\u2019ll come back around to this shortly.\nThe Price for Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve\nDr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve is available in small (up to women\u2019s size 6 and men\u2019s size 7) and large (women\u2019s size 6.5+ and men\u2019s 7.5-11) sizes.\nOne Bunion Sleeve is priced at $10 plus $12.90 S&H, as well as a $2 web surcharge fee.

What\u2019s this mean? You could lose 50% (or more) in S&H charges than you\u2019ll get back as a refund!\nNonetheless, if you\u2019d like to request a refund, you\u2019ll need to contact Spark Innovators customer service at 855-721-3352.\nMore about Dr. A\u2019s Manufacturer & Their Arbitration Agreement\nDr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve is manufactured by Spark Innovators, who makes many other popular As Seen on TV products, including Brew Caps, Invinceable, Engrave-It Pro, and more. What are HighYa readers saying about these products?\nWith well over 100 reviews (most relating to Invinceable) as of 10/14/15, they had an average rating of 1.5 stars. Common complaints revolved around failure to work as advertised and poor quality.\nDespite this feedback, the company had an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau at the time of our research, with only 7 closed complaints. Of the details available, it seemed most of these referenced similar problems noted here on HighYa.\nFinally, remember that all Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve orders are subject to an arbitration agreement. Want to become part of a class action lawsuit or a trial by jury due to damages caused by the product? With an arbitration agreement in place, your legal rights will be severely limited.\nGiven all of this, is it worth taking a risk on Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve?\nThere Are a Lot of Things To Think about with Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve\nYes, bunion pads like those from Dr. A\u2019s can help temporarily relieve the pain and pressure caused by bunions, as well as aggravation that can lead to worsening pain and other symptoms. Depending on the severity of your bunion, these pads might be used in conjunction with other therapies, such as arch supports, foot strengthening, toe spacers, bunion splints, and more.\nLike any other treatment to relieve pain, some of these options might work better for you than others.\nAnd in relatively rare cases, your bunions might be so severe that the only viable method of reducing your pain and discomfort is via surgery. If you think you might meet this definition, be sure to speak with your physician.\nCompared to other gel pads like Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any meaningful difference in its design, other than the fact that the pad is inserted into a lycra sleeve. Although this might help it stay in place better, it probably won\u2019t be very attractive when wearing dress shoes that show more of your feet.\nBut again, a lot of this will come down to personal preference. But this also means that there\u2019s nothing about Dr. A\u2019s Sleeve that would necessarily make it worth losing the steep, non-refundable S&H charges for giving it a try.\nUltimately, we think your money would be better spent exploring local options, or speaking with your doctor, than placing an order for Dr. A\u2019s Bunion Sleeve.\n", "main_title": "Dr. A's Bunion Sleeve Reviews ", "sub_category_title": "", "domain_name": "highya.com", "blog_title": "Dr. A's Bunion Sleeve Reviews ", "blog_link": "http://www.highya.com/dr-as-bunion-sleeve-reviews", "domain_link": "http://www.highya.com/", "category_title": "Health & Beauty", "category_link": "/category/health-and-beauty"}]
